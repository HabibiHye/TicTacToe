#Tic-Tac-Toe Game
##Tic-Tac-Toe Screenshot

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The game allows two players to take turns playing X and O on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.

##Features
Two players can take turns to play the game.
The game keeps track of scores for both players (X and O).
It displays a message when a player wins, and it keeps track of ties.
You can play again after a game ends by clicking on the board.
The game has a graphical user interface with X and O symbols.
##How to Play
Run the Python script (tictactoe.py) to start the game.
The game starts with Player 1 (X) always going first.
Click on an empty cell on the board to place your symbol (X or O).
The game will alternate between Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O) until there is a winner or a tie.
The game keeps track of scores and displays the winner or a tie message when the game ends.
To play again, simply click anywhere on the board.
##Game Rules
The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols (either X or O) in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Players take turns placing their symbol on the board.
The game ends when one player achieves the winning condition or when all cells on the board are filled without a winner (tie).
